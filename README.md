html_data_miner
==============================

Example notebooks for HTML data mining using beautifulsoup. 

Applied on two different pesticide databases (BCPC and PPDB). Both databases have a different structure and require different techniques to extract the data:
- BCPC serves as easy example as this database requires pretty straight forward scraping.
- PPDB has a less convenient structure (e.g. tables within tables and multiheader tables) which requires, among others, 
searching for the right table and/or manually linking table header to table value.
